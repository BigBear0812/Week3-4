Jim's Weekly Challenge Week 3 - Week 4

Challenge 4.0 - Javascript
The fourth challenge is all about javascript! (with a little bit of css). The primary focus is to create a control that allows users to add and remove items from a list.

The control must have the following requirements:

Select individuals and multiples.
Reorder the right side (you decide how to handle groups)
A submit button that returns the value (just console.log the object).
Below is a screenshot demonstrating an example layout(see challenge_4.0.png). It is by no means a great layout, I just wanted to get a basic example together so you can begin working on it.

You will have 2 weeks to complete this challenge, due at 9:59AM on July 24th. Post here if you have any questions!
